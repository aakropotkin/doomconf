#+TITLE: VTerm Darwin Install

Yo this is a pain in the ass and is easy to botch.

There's a few tricks:

1. Compilation has to happen from within emacs usin `<SPACE> o t'.
2. When emacs compiles it needs `cmake', `make', and `glibtool'
   ( NOT `libtool', this comes from `homebrew' ).
   + Your `config.el' adds `~/.doom.d/cmake' to `PATH', but for whatever
     reason adding `/opt/homebrew/bin' ( containing `glibtool' ) wasn't
     taking effect.
   + You finally got this to "take" by running:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  rm -rf "$HOME/.emacs/.local/straight/build-28.1/vterm;
  export PATH="$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin:$HOME/.doom.d/cmake/bin";
  # This writes some magic `env' file used by emacs AND reinstalls `vterm'
  # module ( doesn't build it though ).
  doom sync;
  # Launch Emacs and use `<SPACE> o t' to build.
#+END_SRC
